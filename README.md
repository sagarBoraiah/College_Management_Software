The basic domain of the application is to show the diffrent phases involved in the development of the software(SDLC).

The diffrent phases of the software development involved and tools used:
1. Requirements and Specification: Initial specifications required for the applications are gathered and are implemented with the help of the tool RTH(Requirement and Testing Hub). Here we can lock the requirements at any time we want and also update it periodically.
2. Design and Development: Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.Argo UML is the leading open source UML modeling tool(Design tool) and includes support for all standard UML diagrams.
